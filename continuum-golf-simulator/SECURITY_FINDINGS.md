# Security Audit: Anti-Cheat Testing Results

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive anti-cheat testing has been completed on the Continuum Golf Simulator. **Three critical exploits were discovered** that allow players to beat the house edge. This document outlines the vulnerabilities, their impact, and recommended fixes.

## Test Date
October 15, 2025

## Vulnerabilities Discovered

### üî¥ CRITICAL: Cherry-Picking Exploit (CVE-2025-001)

**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Players can achieve 109% RTP (beating house by 9%)  
**Exploitability:** HIGH - Easy to execute

**Attack Vector:**
1. Player places low wagers ($5) on poor shots (miss ~60 ft)
2. Player places high wagers ($100) on good shots (miss ~20 ft)
3. Over 50 shots, attacker achieves RTP of 109.03%

**Test Results:**
```
Total wagered: $1,865.00
Total won: $2,033.45
Net profit: $168.45
Effective RTP: 109.03% ‚ùå
```

**Root Cause:**
- Kalman filter batches updates (default 5 shots)
- High-stakes detection only compares against current batch average
- Cherry-picking circumvents both protections

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Implement shot-by-shot Kalman updates for wagers >2√ó session average
2. Track rolling average wager across entire session history
3. Add anomaly detection for wager/quality correlation

### üî¥ CRITICAL: Maximum Exploitation Attack (CVE-2025-002)

**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Combined attack yields $40,664 profit on $1,413 wagered  
**Exploitability:** MEDIUM - Requires knowledge of multiple techniques

**Attack Vector:**
1. **Sandbagging Phase:** 50 shots @ $1 with terrible misses (120 ft) to inflate sigma
2. **Exploitation Phase:** Cherry-pick 20 shots with high wagers on excellent performance

**Test Results:**
```
Exploitation phase:
  Wagered: $1,413.00
  Won: $42,077.01
  Net profit: $40,664.01 ‚ùå
  ROI: 2,878%
```

**Root Cause:**
- P_max inflates dramatically after sandbagging (12.19 ‚Üí 197.03)
- Manual miss distances bypass natural variance
- Kalman filter trusts manipulated data

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Implement outlier detection for miss distances
2. Limit P_max change rate (max 20% per session)
3. Add variance consistency checks
4. Require minimum shots before high-stakes bets

---

### üü° HIGH: Gradual Skill Manipulation (CVE-2025-003)

**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** P_max fails to converge, enabling long-term exploitation  
**Exploitability:** MEDIUM - Requires patience

**Attack Vector:**
1. Alternate between slightly better (40 ft) and worse (60 ft) shots
2. Prevent Kalman filter convergence
3. Maintain inflated P_max over 10+ sessions

**Test Results:**
```
P_max variance: 94.51 ‚ùå
Expected: <0.5
Kalman filter did not converge
```

**Root Cause:**
- Alternating pattern prevents filter stabilization
- No detection for oscillating behavior
- Variance checks not enforced

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Add oscillation detection
2. Increase process noise for unstable patterns
3. Force convergence after N inconsistent sessions

## Exploits That FAILED ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Sandbagging Attack (Standalone)
- **Result:** Lost $1,033.26
- **Why it failed:** Cost of sandbagging exceeded exploitation gains
- **Status:** PROTECTED

### ‚úÖ Multi-Account Collusion
- **Result:** Combined loss of $1,778.01 across 3 accounts
- **Why it failed:** Each account tracked independently
- **Status:** PROTECTED

### ‚úÖ Session Interruption
- **Result:** 15.46% RTP (house still wins)
- **Why it failed:** Batching prevents exploitation
- **Status:** PROTECTED

### ‚úÖ Sudden Skill Jump Detection
- **Result:** Anomaly detected with 36.9% skill improvement
- **Why it succeeded:** Detection system flagged suspicious pattern
- **Status:** WORKING (Detection only, no prevention)

## Recommendations (Priority Order)

### Priority 1: IMMEDIATE (Deploy within 24 hours)

1. **Disable Manual Miss Distances in Production**
   - Developer mode should never be available to real players
   - This closes the primary attack vector

2. **Implement Per-Shot Kalman Updates for Large Wagers**
   ```rust
   if wager > session_avg_wager * 2.0 {
       update_kalman_immediately();
   }
   ```

3. **Add Maximum P_max Change Limit**
   ```rust
   let max_p_max_change = previous_p_max * 0.20; // 20% max change
   new_p_max = previous_p_max.min(calculated_p_max).min(previous_p_max + max_p_max_change);
   ```

### Priority 2: HIGH (Deploy within 1 week)

4. **Integrate Anti-Cheat Module**
   - Use `src/anti_cheat.rs` for real-time detection
   - Log all anomalies with confidence scores
   - Auto-flag accounts with confidence >0.7

5. **Add Wager/Quality Correlation Monitoring**
   ```rust
   if detect_cherry_picking(session_shots).is_suspicious {
       limit_max_wager_variance();
       notify_fraud_team();
   }
   ```

6. **Implement Outlier Detection**
   - Flag shots >3 standard deviations from player's mean
   - Reduce Kalman weight for outliers
   - Require manual review for extreme outliers

### Priority 3: MEDIUM (Deploy within 1 month)

7. **Session History Analysis**
   - Track P_max trends across sessions
   - Detect oscillation patterns
   - Force convergence for unstable accounts

8. **Enhanced High-Stakes Detection**
   - Use rolling average across all sessions
   - Consider lifetime average, not just batch
   - Graduated response (1-shot update ‚Üí manual review)

9. **Variance Consistency Checks**
   - Compare session variance to expected for handicap
   - Flag accounts with suspicious variance patterns

## Anti-Cheat Module

A new `src/anti_cheat.rs` module has been created with:

- `detect_sandbagging()` - Identifies inflation attempts
- `detect_cherry_picking()` - Finds bet timing exploitation  
- `detect_skill_jump()` - Flags potential account sharing
- `AnomalyReport` - Structured reporting with confidence scores

**Integration Status:** ‚úÖ Module created, ‚è≥ Integration pending

## Impact Assessment

### Financial Risk (if deployed as-is)

Assuming 1000 daily players, 10% are exploiters:

- **100 exploiters** using cherry-picking: +$168/day each = **$16,800/day loss**
- **10 exploiters** using maximum exploitation: +$40,664 each = **$406,640 one-time loss**
- **Projected monthly loss:** $504,000 - $1,000,000

### Reputation Risk

- Word spreads quickly in gambling communities
- Exploiters share strategies on forums
- Game becomes known as "beatable"
- Regulatory scrutiny for unfair game mechanics

### Legal Risk

- Wagering games must be provably fair
- Exploitable systems may violate gaming regulations
- Potential lawsuits from honest players who lost

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Security audit complete
2. ‚è≥ Apply Priority 1 fixes
3. ‚è≥ Rerun anti-cheat tests
4. ‚è≥ Achieve 100% pass rate
5. ‚è≥ Deploy to production

---

## Conclusion

The Continuum Golf Simulator has **critical security vulnerabilities** that must be addressed before production deployment. The good news:

- ‚úÖ We discovered these issues in testing (not production)
- ‚úÖ Attack vectors are now documented
- ‚úÖ Fixes are straightforward to implement
- ‚úÖ Anti-cheat detection framework is in place

With the recommended fixes applied, the system can be secure and production-ready.
